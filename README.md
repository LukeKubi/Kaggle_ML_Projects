# Kaggle_ML_Projects
Machine learning projects using Kaggle datasets, focused on data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation in Python.

## Overview

This repository contains machine learning projects built using Kaggle datasets.
The goal of these projects is to practice end-to-end ML workflows, including
exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools & Methods
- Python (pandas, NumPy)
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter notebooks
- Supervised learning models (classification and regression)
- Cross-validation and performance evaluation

## Projects
- Titanic Survival Prediction (classification)

These projects reflect a quantitative, data-driven approach to problem solving.
