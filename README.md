# Kaggle_ML_Projects
Machine learning projects using Kaggle datasets, focused on data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation in Python.

## Overview

This repository contains machine learning projects built using Kaggle datasets.
The goal of these projects is to practice end-to-end ML workflows, including
exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools & Methods
-> Python (pandas, NumPy)
-> scikit-learn
-> Jupyter notebooks
-> Supervised learning models (classification and regression)
-> Cross-validation and performance evaluation

## Projects
These projects reflect a quantitative, data-driven approach to problem solving.

### Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (classification)
- **Approach**: Feature engineering with title extraction, cabin deck analysis, and family size
- **Models**: Random Forest (80.4%) vs XGBoost (82.2%)
- **Result**: 82.16% cross-validation accuracy
